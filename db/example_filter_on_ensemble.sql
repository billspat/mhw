-- example of a method to filter on 'ensemble' for a scenario
-- in this database the ensemble is stored as a character string with leading zeros:  001 002 010 
-- if you compare that against a string that is a list of ensembles with a separator like this '080,090,010' 
-- this sql will include those ensembles that are on the list.   
-- the list of ensembles must be a single string and the separator does not have to be a comma
